#### Event Management and Registration:
To arrange and handle events is not a simple job. It needs many steps like creating events, managing registrations, tracing attendees, and making sure that all data is saved correctly for easy access when required. Those who participate in the event may also find it difficult to locate an event, register for it and keep track of events they are interested in.
##### Common Issues:
* Event Organization: Coordinating event details like date, time, location, and capacity.
* Registration Management: Handling attendee registrations, including confirming attendance and managing capacities.
* User Management: Ensuring secure user data handling, including roles for organizers and attendees.
#### Solution Overview
The suggested app tackles these problems head-on with a robust event management framework. Users can generate, handle and sign up for events through this system. Let's see how it resolves the particular issues:
##### Event Creation and Management:
* Event Details: Those who arrange events can make events with all the needed details like title, description, date and time, place, organizer details, capacity and status.
* CRUD Operations: The application allows for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations on events. Organizers can effectively handle event details.
##### Registration Management:
* Registration of Attendees: People can sign up for events, and the application will keep a record of their registration information such as status and extra details.
* Capacity Management: The app aids in managing the capacity of an event. It avoids excessive registration and assists with handling attendees effectively.
##### User Management:
* User Roles: The system differentiates between organizers and attendees in order to allow the right access and functionalities based on user roles.
* Data Handling that is Secure: The application manages user data safely by saving passwords in hashed form and guaranteeing protection for all user details.
#### Detailed Breakdown
##### Event Management:
* Create Events: Organizers can make new events by giving needed details. The plan for the event takes care of the method to include events into database.
* View Events: The event blueprint shows a list of all events to both the people who organized them and those attending. Event data is fetched from database by the event blueprint and presented in an easy-to-understand manner.
* Update Events: If there are any changes, organizers can alter event details. The event blueprint is responsible for saving updated information in a correct manner.
* Delete Events: If there are events that have passed or become irrelevant, organizers have the ability to delete them. This helps in maintaining an updated and relevant list of events.
##### User Management:
* Register Users: For new users to sign up, they should give a username, an email and a password. The user blueprint makes sure this information is kept safe.
* Roles for Users: People using the app may possess different roles, like "organizer" or "attendee", that impact their abilities within this application.
* User Authentication: Users can log in securely, with their credentials verified against stored data.
##### Attendee Management:
* Event Registration: People can register for events they want to participate in. The attendee blueprint controls the registration details, linking persons with events.
* Track Registration: The app knows who comes to each event and handles their registration.
* Manage Capacity: The app stops over-registration by verifying the event's maximum capacity before accepting new registrations.

This app makes it easier to organize and handle events, giving a simple solution for those who arrange the event as well as people participating in it. It manages event details, user information and registration processes effectively. The app is easy to use, dealing with typical problems encountered when managing an event
